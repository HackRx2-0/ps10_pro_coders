My first post graduation was in ENT, which I completed in 2011 from Dr VMMC, Solapur, another reputed institute of the state. During my years in ENT I got attracted towards head and neck cancers. With this attraction I pursued my Masters in Radiation Oncology from Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, one of the globally acknowledged cancer treatment and research center. During my 4 years 3 months tenure in Tata Hospital, I acquired skills not only across various aspects of patient management but also my experience at this high volume center has nurtured me into a better human being. Currently I am working as a Consultant in Radiation Oncology in Jupiter Hospital, Pune. This hospital is equipped with state of the art radiation therapy machines which primarily minimizes the side effects without compromising the cancer killing abilities.

I am interested in promoting awareness regarding different cancer treatment modalities available today and bridging the gap between the patients and doctors.

Dr. Shrivastav has always kept his patient's needs as his priority.  From those days when WhatsApp and other multi media modes were not available to the use of patients and doctors,  he used to ask his patients to compare the area with number of  Re. 1 coin can cover whole your area;  this way he was able to gauge appropriate approximation of the follicle needs of the patient.

He first started using his 0 degree Operating microscope connected to a TV screen for the purpose of TRICHOSCAN....
PLUS the 4 Ds theory of the trichoscan 
Density 
Dandruff 
Direction and 
Diseases ( like psoriasis) 
To determine the future of the transplant process. 

He was the first to adopt and design OXYCOOL AMP TECHNIQUE WITH COLD LIGHT IN THE O.T..
and so on.

Some are like using multiple slits to fasten the procedure and reduce follicle necrosis

At SAI COSMETICS with these innovations by Dr Amitabh and Ruchi Shrivastava started coming up with written assurances,  and graphic representation presented to the practice,  again this is something which has been done before,  still SAI COSMETICS always has proved to be dealing with the issue of high end costing effectively,  an assurance that  only the  trained doctors will do the procedure.. all in one..

I believe that you are the greatest expert on your condition, and I take time to listen carefully to all your symptoms and concerns. In this way I aim to help you regain the best possible level of health, and restore your vitality and sense of well-being. I work with people of all ages with all kinds of health problems.

What happens in a Consultation?
A homeopathic consultation will last for up to 30-45 minutes and during that time you get an opportunity to explain in detail all of your concerns about your health, past and present, physical and emotional. You will be asked for relevant details of your personal and your family medical history, and you will need to provide information about what medication you have taken in the past or are taking currently.

In a consultation you get to explore, with a sympathetic listener, what factors may have contributed to your current health difficulties, in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. Many people find this process therapeutic in itself.

At the end of the consultation we will summarize what we have agreed to focus on, and relevant homeopathic remedies will then be given to you with clear instructions as to how to take them. A follow up appointment will then be made so that we can review what has been discussed and you can give feedback as to the effect of the remedies. This will usually be about a month after the first consultation but it may be less or more, depending on your individual needs.",MBBS , MD - Pediatrics , Fellowship in Pediatric Neurology,,,,,True , True , True,,,,,"B J Medical College, Pune "," B J Medical College, Pune "," AMRITA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES & RESEARCH CENTRE, ERNAKULAM",,,,,2006 , 2009 , 2013,,,,,General Surgeon,,,,,,,,,,,,General Surgeon,,,,,,,,,,,,Doctor,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,252775,Dr. Vinay Gorhe,,35.0,300,Kothrud,18.501047,73.81401,Clinic,Pet Cover,True,"In the mid-1970’s, a ten-year-old Vinay Gorhe spent a lot of time with his cats at home. Then he went looking for stray dogs he could feed. Somewhere during these interactions, he dreamt of becoming a vet. Forty years later, Dr. Vinay Gorhe is among the most respected vets and has among the best-equipped clinics to treat small animals in Pune.

The journey began when he finished veterinary studies from the Bombay Veterinary College in 1984. A stint with the Katraj Dairy followed. Next, he worked with the PMC as a veterinarian for the then Peshwe Park (zoo) and soon he began the search for a place to start practice on his own. He found it in the verandah of Nandakumar Jadhav, near Karve Statue in Kothrud, Pune. That was 30 years ago. Now, his swanky clinic is situated just across the road from where he began.

What he loves most about the job is that every day is different – there’s never a ‘normal’ day and never a ‘boring’ one. In fact, taking a day off just doesn’t work. His mantra: patience with patients. He says communicating effectively with pet parents as well as with pets is hugely rewarding. As a vet, his job for any case is to keep the welfare of the pet and the ability of the owner to nurture it at the top of his mind.

Dr. Gorhe is the author of the acclaimed Marathi book ‘Guni Sobti: Kutra Paltana’ translated from Marathi, it means: ‘Taking care of your faithful friend’ and true to its name, the book gives an Indian perspective on what it takes to have a healthy and happy pet. It sheds light on the right way to select a pup, lists the stages of growing up, common diseases, mating, pregnancy and much more. It is a head to toe guide for pet parents.",DNB - Rheumatology , MBBS,,,,,,True , True,,,,,,"Jehangir Hospital, Pune "," Maharashtra Universtity of Health Sciences, Nashik",,,,,,2010 , 2006,,,,,,Neurologist,,,,,,,,,,,,Neurologist,,,,,,,,,,,,Doctor,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,

Good sexologist doctor.... how to find?

Dear readers, do you know difference between general doctor and a sexologist doctor?

Sexologist doctor is specially trained to talk on sex without making you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed.

A good sexologist should be knowledgeable about all the important branches of medicine that are directly concerned with sexual problems like Urology, Andrology, Gynecology, Endocrinology, Psychiatry, Psychology, and 
Most importantly Internal Medicine....

Good sexologist should have good communication skills and must have time to ask detailed questions regarding sex life of the patient.

Only a senior and experienced Sexologist will be able to understand the real causes of your problem and offer scientific and logical explanation that appeals to common sense. 

Therefore, after the consultation, a patient must feel confident and hopeful of a solution to the problem instead of feeling scared or depressed. 

Permanent cure is possible by a senior experienced sexologist who takes detailed history, offers diagnosis, gives sex education, provides counselling and therapy and suggests time bound treatment. Your participation and sincere efforts are very crucial too.

I am practicing as a sexologist since 1987 along with my medical practice since 1984 and it gives me immense satisfaction to permanently cure sexual problems of my patients.""",MBBS , MS - Orthopaedics , DNB - Orthopedics/Orthopedic Surgery,,,,,True , True , True,,,,,B J Medical College Ahemdabad ," Sancheti Institute for Orthopaedics & Rehabilitation ,Pune "," DNB board, New Delhi",,,,,1998 , 2003 , 2004,,,,,Ophthalmologist/ Eye Surgeon,,,,,,,,,,,,Ophthalmologist,,,,,,,,,,,,Doctor,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,

As a Psychologist, she has more than eight years of experience dealing with the problems faced by adults, teenagers, married couples, senior citizens, alcoholics, drug addicts, victims of domestic abuse and human trafficking and so on! She consults clients on prior appointment basis at The Family Doctor clinic and Medcliniq Diagnostic center (Pune).
Shama also conducts workshops on mental and emotional well-being at various leading companies, assisting as many people as possible in their healing. She is often referred as Happiness Coach/Chief Happiness Officer (CHO) by the company/organization heads, after they witness her happiness workshop. She has successfully executed several sessions on Life Management (aka stress management) where she explores the genesis of stress and creates a less intimidating understanding of the same.
Shama has authored two books. In her first book titled ‘21 Ways of Being Happy’ she conveys the message that one is responsible for one’s own happiness. She reminds the reader that it is in one’s own hand to overcome guilt, self pity, regret, anxiety and other mental barriers that one builds around oneself that drives happiness away. According to her, happiness can be defined as the ability to be in love and peace with oneself every minute of consciousness, whatever circumstances one may experience. She believes that as human beings, we are bound to have ups and downs in life and hence, believing in the terms like ‘a state of perpetual happiness’ creates unnecessary pressure on our Being. Instead of seeking that perpetual happiness, she reinstates the art of embracing one’s self, even at the times when happiness seems long lost.
Her second book ‘Alfaaz (Between Love & the Beloved)’ include poems and the Nazm that celebrate love, passion, longing, unfolding the richness of the human heart.
Shama is an ardent believer in the trinity of the Body, Mind and Soul and her practice and writing strongly reflects this philosophy.",BAMS,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,Aryangla Medical College,,,,,,,1998,,,,,,,Laparoscopic Surgeon (Obs & Gyn) , Infertility Specialist,,,,,,,,,,,Gynecologist/Obstetrician , Gynecologist/Obstetrician,,,,,,,,,,,Doctor , Doctor,,,,,,,,,,,True , True,,,,,,,,,,

Achieving gratification through helping others is most important to me.

What I like best about my work is when I give a patient a “smile” that they are proud to wear. In some cases, a patient’s appearance affects their ability to interact successfully with others. Many patients won’t smile because they believe they have an unattractive smile. Often one or two appointments may correct the problem. Other times, it may take months to make a difference. My artistic and creative abilities have really helped me as a dentist. Being good with your hands and being compassionate are also necessary skills in good dental practice.

The most difficult, yet satisfying part of my job is planning the overall treatment of a patient. A dentist needs to look at the whole person, not just their teeth. A dentist is generally the first one to identify systemic diseases, because many diseases present their first signs and symptoms in the head and neck region. The detection of a possible systemic disease places a great responsibility on the dentist, and emphasizes the importance of staying current in the knowledge of good dental practice.

The treatment planning process is very time consuming and requires thinking in many different directions at one time. There is not always one treatment option for one problem. A dentist must think of different options, not only the most complex and expensive, but also the ones that will best suit the patient’s income, function and longevity.

What I like least about my work is when patients walk away with beautiful new teeth, but do not understand the importance of good oral hygiene practices necessary to maintain their new healthy teeth. The military dental care is free, and patients often do not appreciate the amount of time and effort that goes into their care.",MPTh/MPT - Sports Physiotherapy,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,Guru Nanak Dev University,,,,,,,2008,,,,,,,Obstetrician , Infertility Specialist,,,,,,,,,,,Gynecologist/Obstetrician , Gynecologist/Obstetrician,,,,,,,,,,,Doctor , Doctor,,,,,,,,,,,True , True,,,,,,,,,,

She is an ex banker with 15 years of Investment and transaction banking experience with top most banks. In midst of the hustle bustle of climbing the corporate ladder, she felt a strong need to fulfill her life's purpose in the area of healing.
This arena had held a strong fascination for her since youth. She became a Reiki healer when she was 18 years old. She had questions about Life and its purpose which led her to continue her to study Reiki, Neuro Linguistic Programming and Hypnotherapy. She has acquired specialisation in Clinical Hypnotherapy, Life between Lives Spiritual Regression, Past Life Regression and Inner Child Work. 

Her ethos in life comes from this paradigm from Pierre De Chardin - "" We are not human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human experience.""
